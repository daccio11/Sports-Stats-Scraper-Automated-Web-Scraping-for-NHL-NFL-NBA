🛠 How It's Made <br>
* Tech Used: <br>
* Python (Core Language)<br>
* BeautifulSoup (Web Scraping)<br>
* Requests (Fetching Web Data)<br>
* Pandas (Data Processing)<br>
* Tabulate (Formatted Output)<br>
<br>

This project uses BeautifulSoup to parse Wikipedia pages and extract structured data from HTML tables. The extracted data is processed using Pandas, allowing users to filter, clean, and export the information in a user-friendly format.
<br>
The program features an interactive command-line menu, enabling users to:
<br>

1. Select a dataset (NHL, NFL, NBA).<br>
2. Scrape real-time sports data dynamically. <br>
3. Choose a file format for exporting the data.<br>
4. Download multiple datasets without restarting the script. <br>
<br>
<br>

⚡ Optimizations<br>
  Data Validation ✅ → Ensures extracted data matches column headers before adding to the dataset.<br>
  Improved User Experience 🏆 → Looping menu allows users to download multiple datasets in one session.<br>
<br>
<br>

🎯 Lessons Learned: <br>
  Mastering Web Scraping Challenges → Handling dynamic HTML structures, missing values, and nested tables. <br>
  Optimizing Code Efficiency → Refactored scraping logic to reduce runtime & improve data accuracy.<br>
  Error Handling & Validation → Implemented better input validation to prevent invalid selections.<br>
  Practical File Management → Gained experience in exporting data dynamically in multiple formats.<br>
<br>
<br>

💡 Future Enhancements: <br>
✔️ Automate daily scraping & scheduling 📅 <br>
✔️ Add data visualization using Matplotlib 📊<br>
✔️ Expand to more sports datasets 🏀🏈🏒<br>
