## 🚀 **How It's Made**
### **Tech Used:**
- 🐍 **Python** (Core Language)
- 🌍 **BeautifulSoup** (Web Scraping)
- 📡 **Requests** (Fetching Web Data)
- 📊 **Pandas** (Data Processing & Cleaning)
- 📋 **Tabulate** (Formatted Output)

This project leverages **BeautifulSoup** to parse Wikipedia tables, extracting structured data dynamically.  
With **Pandas**, the extracted data is processed, cleaned, and stored in a structured format, making it ready for analysis.

**🎯 Features:** <br>
✅ **Interactive dataset selection** (NHL, NFL, NBA)    
✅ **Download stats in multiple formats** (CSV, Excel, JSON)  
✅ **Looping menu** for continuous data retrieval
